/**
 * This is a bundle activator which is responsible for configuring Weld bundle to be used in GlassFish.
 *
 * As part of configuration, it configures the the SingletonProvider in Weld.
 * It sets different SingletonProvider for different profiles. e.g., in WebProfile,
 * it sets {@link org.jboss.weld.bootstrap.api.helpers.TCCLSingletonProvider}, where
 * as for full-jakartaee profile, it uses {@link org.glassfish.weld.ACLSingletonProvider}.
 * It tests profile by testing existence of
 * {@link org.glassfish.javaee.full.deployment.EarClassLoader}.
 * <p>
 * Since Weld 1.1, an implementation of the {@link org.jboss.weld.serialization.spi.ProxyServices}
 * SPI is used to provide a classloader to load javassist defined proxies.
 * This classloader ensures that they can load not only application defined classes but also classes
 * exported by any OSGi bundle as long as the operation is happening in the context of a Jakarta EE app.
 * <p>
 * The bundle activator resets the SingletonProvicer in stop().
