High Availability Administration Guide

Release 7

Contributed 2018 - 2024

This book describes thehigh-availability features in {productName},
including converged load balancing, HTTP load balancing, clusters,
session persistence and failover.

Note: The main thrust of the {productName} 7
release is to provide an application server for developers to explore
and begin exploiting the new and updated technologies in the Jakarta EE 10
platform. Thus, the clustering, standalone instance and high
availability features of {productName} were not a focus of this
release. These features are included in the release, but they may not
function properly with some of the new features added in support of the
Jakarta EE 10 platform.
